            First of all, NO! You don't have to stick to it to a T. However,
            this is, of course, what they're used to:

            ** If you're leaving right after giving them their food, they need
            dinner AND dessert. This is mostly because Xander becomes
            destructive if not. Prepare 2 kongs with either PB or Coconut oil.
            Give Xander his food, then tell Tex to go to his crate and give him
            his food. Then, grab the dessert and set it in Tex's crate and close
            him up. Last, give Xander his dessert on his bed *right* before
            leaving.

            Prepare the kongs with a bit of Skippy peanut butter or coconut oil.
            You can also do a mixture of both. Add roughly half of a butter
            knife's worth inside of the kong. For Xander, make sure it's not too
            deep in the kong.

            We switched the harnesses. Tex uses the black and grey harness. The
            black strap goes around his belly, the grey strap goes in front of
            his chest. Xander's is the blue harness and goes over his head and
            buckles on either side.

            Xander must always poop in the mornings, but Tex doesn't have to.
            Sometimes they both poop twice a day and sometimes they only poop
            once. Just make sure Xander poops in the morning or he'll probably
            have an accident.

            to wear his shoes in the afternoon. When putting them on, be careful
            of his duclaw. He's not a fan of them, just fair warning. If you
            don't have time, it's raining, or any other reason you can't put
            them on, it's okay. Just use the baby whipes above the washing
            machine to clean off his paw after. The goal is to get the pollen
            off.

            No, it's just really hard to open. We'll set out an HEB bag you can
            use inside for trash, so the only thing you need from the closet
            should be their food. Just keep twisting the knob and it'll
            eventually open.

            They don't need watered. If a storm comes through or its very windy,
            you might have to bring them in. It's okay if you put them in the
            wrong places, just as long as they're inside. Any pots with dirt but
            NO plant in it can stay outside.

            Since we aren't home, they can both sleep on the bed together. They
            should be fine, but if you want to be sure, make sure they don't
            fall asleep too close to each other.
